# 01-02Challenge

## Description

Horiseon - Social Solution Services website has been refactored to meet accessibility standards, improve code quality, enhance user experience when reading or listening to the code, and to improve its SEO raking. 

I was motivated to work on this project because it gave me the opportunity to help make the web more accessible for people with disabilities 
while also having a chance to expand my web development skills.

During this project, I primarily learned about web accessibility, semantic HTML, and code refactoring.
